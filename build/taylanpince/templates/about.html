<p>In the past 8 years, I worked with a variety of clients, using 
    a diverse array of technologies to create web experiences that 
    are rich, accessible and easy to use. I am passionate about 
    good web design, both on the client side, and the server side.</p>

<p>I don't like being tied up with a specific technology in the 
    ever-evolving online world. However, I have found a very good 
    balance of speed and functionality in Python and Django. After 
    working with these tools for the past two years, they have 
    become centric to my craft.</p>

<p>My background in visual arts is very important to me. I continue 
    to be involved in the art community in Toronto and experiment 
    with photography whenever I find the time.</p>
